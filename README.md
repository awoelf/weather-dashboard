# Weather Dashboard

## About the Project
Find weather conditions for cities with a simple search. The Weather Dashboard will return the city that you searched, the date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. A 5-day forecast is also created with the same information displayed. Previous searches are logged to a button list that allows you to search for those cities with just a click.
